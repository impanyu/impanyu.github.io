		This project implements a chat room application based on node.js, socket.io and express framework.The user can create his name to connect to the chat room. If the user input empty room, the warning of empty name will prompt and the user needs to re-input a valid name. If there are more than 10 people in the room, the user will get notified to wait.If the user goes into the chat room, he can send his messages to everyone in the room, or click "thumbs up" button to send a thumsup icon. Or the user can click the "List All Users" button to take a look at all the users currently online. Each user will have a different color for their messages.
If the user does not do anything in the room for more than 15 secs, he will be sent back to the index page.This project is very interesting to me. It demostrates the power of node technology which deals with concurrency with asynchronized IO in a single thread. This is different from multithread or multiplex method which are adopted in other server side technology.

	<li><a href="http://nodejs-ypan16.rhcloud.com/tank2.html" target="_blank">http://nodejs-ypan16.rhcloud.com/tank2.html</a> A tank shooting game implemented using javascript/HTML5.All datas between browsers make use of RTCDataChannel(direct P2P, not through server). All animations are drawn on HTML canvas, no extra framework/engine used.Use http to signal between client and server.Server is implemented using node.js.Have several technics to sync the state between two clients,like,the states of tanks,shots.Develop my own algorithm for collision detection, which is key points bump detection.This algorithm is suitable for rectangle collision detection.</li>

	<li><a href="http://impanyu.github.io/myVideoPlayer/">http://impanyu.github.io/myVideoPlayer/</a>This project implements a youtube like web video player . All components are implemented using plain Javascript or JQuery. Playlist is read from an json file. All the watched video progress are stored using browser's localstorage mechanism, so that the browser can reseek to its saved progress if the page is refreshed.

The main technical points are jquery AJAX for retrieving the compilation/execution results;using bootstrap for webpage layout; creating a new process to call compiler and java virtual machine; reading error message and output from this process; user separation(different user must have separate source and executable file)</li>

These two parts communicate through SOAP webservice framework.WebServiceClient use WSDL file to establish webservice proxy, and it adopts a MVC structure, and uses JDBC to retrieve information from MySQL database. Every object which need to be transfered through the network were serialized into XML and capsulated in SOAP. For java.sql.Date object, I write an adapter to change it from(to) a String object.</li>

<h1>Here is the list of part of my works</h1>
<ol>
<li>

<a href=https://github.com/impanyu/QA_RNN target="_blank"><strong>Teaching Machine to Answer Question Using Recurrent Neural Networks and Attentive Reader</strong></a>
This work is the Tensorflow implementation of the paper "Text Understanding with the Attention Sum Reader Network". It adopts attentive mechanism which improves the precision compared with the naive RNN. The dataset is based on the paper "Towards AI-Complete Question Answering: A Set of Prerequisite Toy Tasks".

<a href=http://cse.unl.edu/~ypan/map11.html target="_blank"><strong>Heterogeneous precipitation data visualization</strong></a>
This work is part of a NSF funded project, which aims to facilitate the visualization of large scale geophysical data. We've invented Hierachical Spherical Triangular Mesh (HSTM) as the index of spatial index in the database and thus facilitate both data co-alignment and load balancing. Also, HSTM makes heterogeneous data reside in the same database and resolves the data variety challenge. The experiments shows our schema outperforms existing technologies and we'd like to see its profound impact on geophysical visualization. <br>
This work also leads to the paper "Visual Analytics with Unparalleled Variety Scaling for Big Earth Data" published on the conference of Big Data 2017.

	<li><a href="http://ec2-54-201-121-33.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:5001/tank2.html" target="_blank"><strong>A tank shooting game</strong></a> A tank shooting game implemented using javascript/HTML5.All datas between browsers make use of RTCDataChannel(direct P2P, not through server). All animations are drawn on HTML canvas, no extra framework/engine used.Use http to signal between client and server.Server is implemented using node.js.Have several technics to sync the state between two clients,like,the states of tanks,shots.Develop my own algorithm for collision detection, which is key points bump detection.This algorithm is suitable for rectangle collision detection.</li>

	<li><a href="http://webcompile-ypan16.rhcloud.com/OJ/main.html"><strong>A web Java/C++ compilation system</strong></a>A Web Compilation and Execution system for Java and C++. The main technical points are jquery AJAX for retrieving the compilation/execution results;using bootstrap for webpage layout; creating a new process to call compiler and java virtual machine; reading error message and output from this process; user separation(different user must have separate source and executable file)</li>

 <li><a href=http://impanyu.github.io/crazytraffic/index6.html target="_blank"><strong>A traffic game</strong></a>This project is a two-episode game in which the player has to control the signal light to let the traffic pass through the intersection. The game demonstrates how to use plain javascript/jquery to build a fancy game without the use of a game framework. A bunch of asynchronous event is leveraged for UI control and the loading process. OOP is adopted. Also some popular javascript techniques such as local storage is used. This game can be considered as a SPA(Single Page Application) which is cross-platform due to the attribute of web apps.

	<li><a href=http://ec2-54-201-121-33.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3000 target="_blank"><strong>A chat room</strong></a> This project implements a chat room application based on node.js, socket.io and express framework.The user can create his name to connect to the chat room. If the user input empty room, the warning of empty name will prompt and the user needs to re-input a valid name. If there are more than 10 people in the room, the user will get notified to wait.If the user goes into the chat room, he can send his messages to everyone in the room, or click "thumbs up" button to send a thumsup icon. Or the user can click the "List All Users" button to take a look at all the users currently online. Each user will have a different color for their messages.
If the user does not do anything in the room for more than 15 secs, he will be sent back to the index page.This project is very interesting to me. It demostrates the power of node technology which deals with concurrency with asynchronized IO in a single thread. This is different from multithread or multiplex method which are adopted in other server side technology.

	<li><a href="http://impanyu.github.io/myVideoPlayer/"><strong>A web video player</strong></a>This project implements a youtube like web video player . All components are implemented using plain Javascript or JQuery. Playlist is read from an json file. All the watched video progress are stored using browser's localstorage mechanism, so that the browser can reseek to its saved progress if the page is refreshed. There is also a separate progress bar indicating the buffered video.</li>

These two parts communicate through SOAP webservice framework.WebServiceClient use WSDL file to establish webservice proxy, and it adopts a MVC structure, and uses JDBC to retrieve information from MySQL database. Every object which need to be transfered through the network were serialized into XML and capsulated in SOAP. For java.sql.Date object, I write an adapter to change it from(to) a String object.</li>
